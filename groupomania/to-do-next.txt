To do:
-add multimedia to post (multer saves picture to directory but doesn't save path in db, setState of picture
      is files[0], and probable problem is i can't extract the name from the file, name that appears in the object if i log it to the console)
-identify posts that have been read already 
-wcag
-manage permissions/secure website OWASP

(unnecessary)-read, update and delete Posts and add like 


QUESTIONS:
